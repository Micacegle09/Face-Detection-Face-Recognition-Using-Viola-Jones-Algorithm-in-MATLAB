# Face-Detection-Face-Recognition-Using-Viola-Jones-Algorithm-in-MATLAB
<p align="justify">For innumerable years, one of the most traversed affairs in computer sight has been face detection. The highest certainty results for face detection using Viola-jones were acquired at 90.9 % for facial image detection. It also analyzed the execution of the Viola-Jones approach in comparison to other face identification algorithms while identifying faces. Voila-jones method proved to be successful in this prior study. In this flow, keeping in mind those changes and approaches and in order to achieve better outcomes in accuracy, this strategy will be applied to the face identification algorithm in MATLAB by extracting different facial features like eyes, mouth, and nose separately. This would be done in two approaches, i.e., face detection and face recognition.</p>
